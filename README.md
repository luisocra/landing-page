# landing-page

I learned a lot in this project. Mostly that I really have no idea of what I'm doing yet, and I'm nowhere near prepared to actually build a site that works like it should.
I barely have responsive web design knowledge, and my page definitely isn't all that responsive :p (couldn't even get the fixed navbar to show in my resized browser). That doesn't matter all that much to me though, as I haven't really read much about the topic anyways.
The problem that this project made me realize is that I'm wasting too much time on things that aren't necessary. Mostly design stuff, which can be quite entertaining. The fact that I'm having fun and enjoying the learning process and the practice is good, but my time management is not.
I put about 10 hours on this one project when it could have easily been 2 or 3. Definitely not letting this happen again.
